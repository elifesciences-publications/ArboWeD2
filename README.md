# ArboWeD2
(Arbo)virus (We)ather (D)riven (D)ynamics R-Package

This is the repository for the development code of a future R-package.

The package is intended to simulate and fit epidemics of arboviruses driven by climatic variables (humidity, precipitation and temperature).

Current development material includes functional code, simple figure output and mock data.

Code includes a mix of C/C++ files, bash script and R scripts.

Reference to scientific publication demonstrating methodology to be included soon.

Please contact repo maintainer if problems are found.
